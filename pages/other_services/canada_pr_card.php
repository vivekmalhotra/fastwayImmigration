                When the new immigrant lands in Canada, they need not apply for Permanent Resident Card.  However, within 180 days after immigrating to Canada, they need to tell IRCC their Canadian mailing address where PR Card may be sent.   If IRCC is not informed about Canadian Address within this period, they shall have to apply for their Permanent Resident Cards.  The eligibility requirement for applying for PR Card is that you are the permanent resident of Canada and are applying from within Canada. However, if you are outside Canada, you need to apply for <strong>permanent resident travel document</strong> to Canadian Consulate outside Canada to return to Canada and apply for PR Card after you arrive Canada.
