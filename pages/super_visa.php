                A super visa lets you visit your children or grandchildren for up to 2 years at a time. It’s a multi-entry visa that provides multiple entries for a period up to 10 years. This Visa is for Parents and grandparents of Permanent Residents or Canadian Citizens currently living in Canada. They cannot be inadmissible to Canada on the basis of health or security. No Dependents can be included in this application. Only parents or grandparents, together with their spouses or common-law partners, may be included on an application for the Super Visa.
            </p>

            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                If a Foreign National has a Canadian Temporary Resident Visa, he/she may visit for up to six months when they first enter Canada unless they apply and get extension for their Visitor Visa. Therefore, visitors who wish to stay longer must apply for an extension, and pay a new fee. Whereas in case of <strong>parent and grandparent super visa,</strong> eligible parents and grandparents can visit their family in Canada for <strong>up to two years</strong> without the need to renew their status.

                A person who is neither a Canadian Citizen nor a Permanent Resident of Canada and wants to visit Canada on holidays/vacations, visit family or conduct business etc.  such Foreign National will need Temporary Resident Visa also known as Visitor Visa to enter Canada.   The requirement for a visa also applies to temporary residents who are transiting in Canada.  All the foreign nationals do not need Temporary Resident Visa to enter Canada.     Citizens of certain countries does not require Temporary Resident Visa.   They need Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to enter Canada.    What you need will depend on where you are from, how you are travelling, and what documents you are travelling with.  Before applying for Temporary Resident Visa, it is advisable you check if your country is in the list of visa exempt countries.   In that case, you will require -Electronic Travel Authorization- eTA.

                Super Visa is a multiple visa issued to the eligible parents and grandparents of Permanent Residents and Citizens of Canada.   Multiple Visa provides for allowing the holder multiple entries for a period up to 10 years.   The key difference is that the Super Visa allows an individual to stay for up to two years on initial entry into Canada whereas in the case of 10-years multiple entry visa, the holder could stay for a period of six months only unless applying and getting extension from within Canada.

            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                Only Parents and Grand Parents of Canadian Citizens or Permanent Residents are eligible for Super Visa.   Their dependents are NOT ELIGIBLE for Super Visa.   But they can apply for a regular visitor Visa.
            </p>

            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                Visa Officer considers several factors before deciding whether an applicant is admissible. Officers must believe the applicant is a genuine visitor to Canada who will leave by choice at the end of the visit. Among other things, the officer might consider are the following:
            </p>

            <ul class="font-size-4">
                <li>the person’s ties to his or her home country</li>
                <li>the purpose of the visit</li>
                <li>the person’s family and financial situation</li>
                <li>the overall economic and political stability of the home country, and</li>
                <li>invitations from Canadian hosts</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                The parent or grandparent must also do the following :
            </p>

            <ul class="font-size-4">
                <li>provide a letter promising financial support from their child or grandchild in Canada who has a minimum income</li>
                <li>prove he or she has Canadian medical insurance for at least one year to cover the time he or she will be in Canada, and</li>
                <li>complete an immigration medical examination</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                The sponsor in Canada will also have to meet certain income and other requirements to be eligible to sponsor a parent or grandparent under the super visa. They must demonstrate that they are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident and their income is above LICO and are willing to provide the applicants with a letter of invitation.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-size-4 color-font-black"><strong>Application Process</strong></h4>
            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                Process is similar to that of a Regular Temporary Resident Visa with additional requirements that the applicants will be well supported by their children/grandchildren during their stay in Canada. Among other things, these requirements include :

            <ul class="font-size-4">
                <li>A letter of invitation from the child or grandchild residing in Canada</li>
