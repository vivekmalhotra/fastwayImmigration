            <h4 class="font-size-4 color-font-black"><strong>Skilled Workers in Manitoba</strong></h4>
            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                The MPNP for Skilled Workers in Manitoba nominates applicants who have a strong connection to our province through ongoing employment and sufficient skills, education and training, work experience and official language proficiency to make an immediate and ongoing contribution to the Manitoba economy and our community at large.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-size-4 color-font-black"><strong>Skilled Workers Overseas</strong></h4>
            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                The MPNP for Skilled Workers Overseas nominates applicants who demonstrate an established connection to Manitoba through :
            </p>
            <ul class="font-size-4">
                <li>the support of family members or friends</li>
                <li>through previous education or work experience in the province, or</li>
                <li>through an Invitation to Apply received directly from the MPNP as part of a Strategic Recruitment Initiative</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                The new <strong>International Education Stream</strong> (IES) for Manitoba graduates is dedicated to providing international students graduating in Manitoba and meeting the needs of industry faster pathways to nomination.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-size-4 color-font-black"><strong>Career Employment Pathway</strong></h4>
            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">

            <h4 class="font-size-4 color-font-black"><strong>International Student Entrepreneur Pilot</strong></h4>
            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                The International Student Entrepreneur Pilot will provide up to 20 (per calendar year) international students who have graduated in Manitoba the opportunity to pursue entrepreneurship rather than employment. Once the applicant meets the conditions of their Business Performance Agreement, they are nominated for permanent residence.
            </p>

            <h2 class="font-size-2 color-font-black py-2"><strong>BUSINESS INVESTORS STREAM</strong></h2>
            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                The renewed <strong>Business Investor Stream</strong> replaces PNP-B business immigration category. BIS allows Manitoba to recruit and nominate qualified business investors and entrepreneurs from around the world who have the intent and ability to start or purchase businesses in Manitoba. Applicants will no longer be required to submit a deposit of $100,000 to the Manitoba government.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-size-4 color-font-black"><strong>Entrepreneur Pathway</strong></h4>
            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                The renewed Entrepreneur Pathway replaces the previous MPNP-B stream. It allows Manitoba to recruit and nominate qualified business people from around the world who have the intent and ability to move to Manitoba and establish, purchase a business or become partners in an existing business within the first 24 months of arrival in Canada on a temporary work permit. Applicants are no longer required to submit a deposit of $100,000 to the Manitoba Government.

            <h4 class="font-size-4 color-font-black"><strong>Farm Investor Pathway</strong></h4>
            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                The renewed Farm Investor Pathway (FIP) replaces the previous Farm Strategic Recruitment Initiative. The Pathway is for individuals with proven farm business experience, sufficient available capital to invest, and who intend to establish and operate a farm operation in rural Manitoba.
            </p>
            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                It is expected that successful applicants of the FIP will establish a farm business in rural Manitoba producing primary products that is consistent with the province’s current farm industry. The type of operation and investment must correlate with Provincial statistics and be relevant to Manitoba’s farm industry. Agri-business operations not producing primary products may qualify under the Entrepreneur Pathway.
