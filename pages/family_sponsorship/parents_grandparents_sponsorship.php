                When you sponsor your parents and grandparents to become permanent residents of Canada, you must meet certain income requirements and support that person and their dependents financially. You and the sponsored relative must sign a sponsorship agreement that commits you to provide financial support for your relative (and any other eligible relatives accompanying them) for a period of three to 20 years depending on their age and relationship to you. This undertaking shall come into force on the date when they become permanent residents. The sponsored person also undertakes that they will make every effort to support themselves.
