                Canadian Government is committed to family unification, whenever possible. It knows that your family is important to you and for that reason, it offers many ways to allow Canadian Citizens and Permanent Residents to sponsor their loved ones to come to Canada under its Family Sponsorship Class.  Sponsoring a family member is one of the fastest category of Canadian Immigration.

                You can sponsor a foreign relative. There are only <strong>three (3)</strong> types of relatives that are eligible to be sponsored by a Canadian:

            <ul class="font-size-4">
                <li>Spouse or common-law partner and</li>

                The types of relatives you can sponsor for permanent residence are extremely specific and <strong>no other types of relatives will be considered</strong>.  No other type of family member is eligible to be sponsored. That means you cannot sponsor or be sponsored by a sibling, cousin, niece, nephew or close friend.  Unless you are married or in common‐law relationship, you cannot sponsor your partner. <strong class="color-font-black">You cannot sponsor your fiancé because engagement provides no status in Canada.</strong>

                <strong>Note:</strong> All sponsors must show that they can provide for the basic needs of the persons being sponsored.

This also applies if you’re sponsoring your dependent child who has a dependent child that is coming with them.

                You can apply under the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada (SLPC) class if your spouse or common-law partner cohabits (lives) with you in Canada and has temporary resident status.

            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                To qualify under the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada class, the sponsored person must:

                <li>be the spouse or common-law partner of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident in Canada, and</li>

                <strong>Important information:</strong> if your spouse or partner is already working or studying in Canada and would like to continue, they must apply for an extension before their work or study permit expires.  Leaving Canada can automatically cancel temporary resident status as a visitor, student or worker.
            </p>

            <p class="font-size-4 py-1">
                If your spouse or common-law partner leaves Canada before becoming a permanent resident, they may not be allowed to come back. This is especially true if they need a Temporary Resident Visa to enter Canada.  Consequently, If your spouse or partner can’t return to Canada, you must submit a new application.
