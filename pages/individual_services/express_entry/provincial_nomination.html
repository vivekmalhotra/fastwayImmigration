                    Each province and territory have its own streams and criteria for their Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) which is available
                    on the website of the province/territory. Provincial Nomination is also an important fast-track option
                    for getting Canadian Permanent Residence. These programs respond to the needs of their specific province.
                    Therefore, each program seeks a peculiar type of immigrant based on meeting specific criteria. For example,
                    in a program stream, provinces and territories may target students, business people, skilled workers
                    or semi-skilled workers. In some Provinces, applicants with family members, close relatives or family
                    friends in that particular province are given additional advantage. Some provinces, based on the Express
                    Entry Profile of applicants in the Pool, automatically invite them to apply based on their Express Entry
                    profile, while others require candidates to actively monitor them and submit applications. Some streams
                    are open to applications all the times whereas others have specific intake periods.
                </p>


                <p>
                    The federal government makes the final decision regarding any application for permanent residence and, therefore, permanent
                    residence application needs to be submitted by the provincial nominee to IRCC. However, securing a provincial
                    nomination greatly increases chances of success for the nominee.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A successful provincial nominee will make an addition of 600 points in their CRS score thereby guaranteeing an <strong>Invitation to Apply</strong>                    for Permanent Residence in the next Express Entry draw.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The eligibility criteria for the PNP is different based on whether you apply through the paper-based <strong>(non-Express Entry streams)</strong>                    or Express Entry (Express Entry streams) process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the online <strong>Express Entry process,</strong> there are two ways to apply:
                </p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li><i class="fa-li fas fa-circle"></i> You contact the province or territory and apply for a nomination
                        under an Express Entry stream</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-li fas fa-circle"></i> If the province or territory agrees to nominate you, you create an
                        Express Entry profile (or update your profile if you already have one) and show you have been nominated</li>
                    <span><strong> OR </strong></span>
                    <li><i class="fa-li fas fa-circle"></i> You create an Express Entry profile and show the provinces and territories
                        you are interested in</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-li fas fa-circle"></i> If a province or territory sends you a <strong>“notification of interest”</strong>                        to your account, you contact them directly</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-li fas fa-circle"></i> You apply to their Express Entry system</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>If you are applying through Express Entry</strong>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><i class="fa-li fas fa-circle"></i> You must meet the minimum requirements of a province or territory’s
                            Express Entry PNP stream.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fas fa-circle"></i> You must be nominated under that stream.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    You must create an Express Entry profile and show that you meet the minimum criteria for Express Entry, including the requirements
                    of one of the immigration programs it covers. You will be asked which provinces and territories you are
                    interested to live. That province may contact you and ask you to submit a PNP application, so they can
                    nominate you. If you already have a nomination, you must show this in your profile.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After a province or territory nominates you, you must apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for permanent
                    residence which will assess your application based on Canadian immigration law. If nomination is through
                    Express Entry, you <strong>must be invited to apply</strong> by IRCC before you can
                    submit an electronic application for permanent residence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To be nominated by a province or territory, you must follow the instructions on their website and contact them directly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Those interested in moving to Canada in 2018 will certainly have some reasons for excitement because Canada continues to
