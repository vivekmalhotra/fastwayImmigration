                </p>

                <p>
                    Such applications will also be assessed based on six selection factors of Age, Education, Work Experience, whether having
                    valid job offer, English and/or French Language abilities, Adaptability. These factors are part of a
                    100-point grid used to assess Federal Skilled Workers. Applicant earns points for how well they do in
                    each of these six factors. The current pass mark is 67 points to qualify for the Express Entry Pool.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Profile remains active for up to 1 year. Candidates in the pool are ranked against others in the pool
                    according to their Comprehensive Ranking System Score. The highest scoring Express Entry candidates are
                    invited to apply regardless of when they entered the Express Entry Pool.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Invitation rounds can be for a specific immigration program (top ranked in that program) or simply the top ranked candidates
                    in the pool. Rounds occur at a frequency and in numbers that align with the annual Immigration Levels

                </p>

                    If invited to apply under the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Candidate will need to show that they meet the settlement funds
                    requirement unless they:

                    financial institutions keeping their money.
                </p>

                <p>
