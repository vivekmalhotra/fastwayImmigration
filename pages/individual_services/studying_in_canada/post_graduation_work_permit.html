                    The Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows students who have graduated from a participating Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience. Skilled Canadian work experience gained through the PGWPP helps graduates qualify for permanent residence in Canada through the Canadian experience class.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Employers seeking to employ open work permit holders are exempt from the requirement to first obtain a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from Service Canada. The open work permits issued to the graduates in line with the PGWPP requirements are coded with the LMIA exemption code C43.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A work permit under the PGWPP may be issued for the length of the study program, <strong> for a maximum of 3 years.</strong> A post-graduation work permit cannot be valid for longer than the student’s study program, which must be a minimum of 8 months in duration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To obtain a work permit under the PGWPP, the applicant must meet the following requirements:
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fas-circle"></i> have a valid study permit when applying for the work permit</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fas-circle"></i> have continuously studied full time in Canada (i.e., studies must have taken place at a Canadian educational institution) and have completed a program of study that is at least 8 months in duration</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fas-circle"></i> have completed and passed the program of study and received a written notification from the educational institution indicating that they are eligible to obtain a degree, diploma or certificate;</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Applicants must apply for a work permit within 90 days of receiving written confirmation (e.g., an official letter or transcript) from the educational institution indicating that they have met the requirements for completing their program of study. Calculation of the 90 days begins the day the student’s final marks are issued or the day formal written notification of program completion is received, whichever comes first.
                </p>

                <h2>Accelerated Programs</h2>
                <p>
                    If the student is enrolled in a program of study that is normally 8 months in duration but the student completes the requirements for the program of study within 6 months, they may be eligible for the PGWPP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given that the program of study must be at least 8 months in duration and not that the student must have been studying for at least 8 months, the student may be eligible for a post-graduation work permit valid for 8 months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students who complete a program of study by distance learning (from outside or inside Canada) are not eligible for the PGWPP.
                </p>

                <h2>Issuance</h2>
                <p>
                    Work permits issued under the PGWPP are LMIA-exempt. These may be open and may be valid for up to 3 years, depending on the duration of the program of study undertaken by the student. PGWPPs are normally issued by the Case Processing Centre in Vegreville (CPC-V). However, by virtue of sections R197 and R198, work permits under the PGWPP may also be issued by Port of Entry or visa offices overseas.
                </p>

                <h2>Validity</h2>
                <p>
                    PGWPP may be valid for up to 3 years. It depends upon the length of the program undertaken by the student which must be confirmed by DLI in official letter or transcript. Regularly scheduled breaks are to be included in the time accumulated towards the length of the work permit. If duration of program of study is at least 8 months but less than 2 years, duration of the work permit will be equivalent to progam of study as confirmed by DLI. However, if duration of program of study is 2 years or longer, the duration of the work permit will be 3 years. Regularly scheduled winter and summer breaks are not subtracted from the length of PGWP.
                </p>
