                    MPNP is an economic immigration program of Manitoba Province designed to attract job ready skilled workers and active investors in Manitoba’s economy.  Under MPNP, foreign nationals with skills and experience targeted by the province may receive Nomination Certificate from the province thereby speeding up the overall immigration process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On November 15, 2017, the Province announced renewal to its Provincial Nominee Program thereby restructuring the program to provide more pathways to Permanent residence to International students and entrepreneurs and to make the program more user friendly. Some changes took effect on November 15, 2017 and others will take effect in New Year. Effective April 2018, Graduates of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) will enjoy faster nomination pathways.  Also Post-secondary international student graduates from Manitoba institutions finding long-term employment in <strong>in-demand occupation</strong> relevant to their training will be able to apply to MPNP without having worked for six months. It will make it easier for international students with Manitoba education to work and settle in the province.
                </p>

                <h2>Skilled Workers</h2>
                <p>
                    Under MPNP there are two streams for Skilled Workers-Skilled Workers Overseas and Skilled Workers in Manitoba. Under these categories, eligible candidates submit their Expression of Interest online by completing a series of questions. They are not required to upload supporting documents. Such profiles are placed in the pool with other eligible candidates and scores are awarded based on the answers provided by the candidates. MPNP then ranks such profiles using several factors and highest scoring candidates are invited to submit their applications. Expression of interest submitted by a candidate remains active for a period of 1 year and is considered in different draws announced by MPNP during this period. There is no limit on the number of EOI’s submitted by the eligible applicants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under MPNP Renewal Plan on November 15, 2017, Manitoba has announced two new pathways each for Skilled Worker in Manitoba Stream & Skilled Workers Overseas.   Under Skilled Workers in Manitoba Stream, these are Manitoba Work Experience Pathway and Employer Direct Recruitment Pathway and in Skilled Workers Overseas Stream,  these are Manitoba Express Entry and Human Capital which targets eligible candidates from in-demand Occupations List. The renewed criteria will come into effect in 2018.
                </p>

                <h2>Business Investor Stream (formerly MPNP-B)</h2>

                <p>
                    Under the renewed Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program, Business Investor Stream has replaced MPNP-B. Business Investor Stream has Entrepreneur and Farm Investor Pathways. Individuals wishing to set up business in Manitoba can do so under Entrepreneur Pathway. The process involves eligible applicants submitting “Expression of Interest” thereby expressing their intention to establish business in Manitoba. Based on their answering eligibility questions in EOI, points are awarded and the most qualified are invited to apply for immigration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Priority is to be given to Research ready candidates with a viable plan, Rural Investors and Francophone Investors. It envisages to give priority to applicants who start a business within the first 12 months of their arrival in Manitoba, particularly outside of Winnipeg.  Effective immediately, applicants in this stream will no longer be required to submit a deposit to the MPNP.  Applicants will instead sign a business performance agreement to purchase an existing business or start a new one, and the MPNP will provide a letter of support for a temporary work permit.  This will ensure that the applicants invest in such businesses as are able to create jobs and achieve better outcomes consistent with the objectives of the program. Renewed Criteria for Business Investor Stream will come into effect in the first quarter of 2018.
                </p>

                <h2>Farm Investor Pathway (formerly Farm Strategic Recruitment Initiative)</h2>
                <p>
                    The Farm Investor Pathway will replace the Farm Strategic Recruitment Initiative in 2018. This pathway allows individuals with farm business experience and sufficient capital to immigrate to establish and operate a farm in the province. Successful FIP applicants are expected to establish a farm business in rural Manitoba producing primary products consistent with the province's current farm industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The process involves submission of Expression of Interest by the eligible applicants under this pathway.  The highest-ranking applicant will receive Letter of Advice to Apply.  On receiving Letter of Advice to Apply, the successful candidates will be submitting complete application to Manitoba Government for nomination.  Their application will be processed at MPNP and  If found eligible under the stream, they will need to sign Deposit Agreement and Submit Deposit.    Having fulfilled these requirements, the candidate will be receiving certificate of nomination from the province.   On the strength of Nomination Certificate, the applicant will need to submit Permanent Resident Application to the Federal Government.
