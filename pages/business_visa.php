                A Business visitor is someone who comes to Canada for international business activities without directly entering the Canadian labor market like meeting people from companies doing business with their country, observing site visits or if a Canadian Company invited them for training in product use, sales and other business transaction functions. For such purposes, they do not need a work permit to come to Canada. But Business visitors must prove that their main source of income and their main place of business are outside Canada.
